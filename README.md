# MobileHub Website

**MobileHub** is a basic front-end web project built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**.It displays a collection of mobile phones from top brands such as Vivo,Samsung,Xiaomi,and Motorola.Each phone card includes essential details like model name,RAM/ROM,camera information,and pricing.

**This is my simple UI design created just for practicing HTML and CSS.**

This was my first project while learning HTML and CSS,And it helped me understand how to structure a web page,style components,and use layout techniques.
